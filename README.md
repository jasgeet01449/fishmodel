<h1>ML FISH WEIGHT PREDICTION MODEL</h1><hr>

INTRODUCTION:<br>
          The model used linear regression to predict weight of the fish. Fish market dataset has records of seven common different fish species in fish market sales Using this model a predictive model can be performed and the weight of the fish can be predicted
          
 REQUIREMENT:<br>
           A Function that would accept the path of the csv file and using that csv file returns the predictions of the model
           Use scikit learn to submit the final model
           
 USED:<br>
          1) Matplotlib <br>
          2)Linear Regression<br>
          3)Python<br>
